# Coding Challenge

This is a solution to build out an advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the [challenge design](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db) as possible.

- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon.
- **Bonus :** While advice is loading, card animates with placeholder text and dice spins.
